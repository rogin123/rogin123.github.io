              For my honors thesis, I modeled the air quality and health impacts of electrifying Chicago's busses. This involved some overly complicated air quality models(SMOKE, CMAQ-WRF, BenMAP) that produced terabytes of data for me to play with. I was able to present my findings at the Fall 2019 American Geophysical Union meeting.

              I worked with a team of three undergraduate interns to build and internally release a completely
              new feature in 10 weeks. At the end of the summer, every GitHub employee had the feature added
              to their GitHub account to try out. We also had the opportunity to present our work to hundreds
              of GitHub employees.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the summer, I was asked to stay on as a contractor to continue developing the feature. I
              took part part in a three-day product summit where my engineering manager, a full-time engineer,
              a product designer, a product manager and I created a roadmap for the next iterations of the
              feature.
